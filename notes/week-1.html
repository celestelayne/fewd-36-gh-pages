	<h2>Git</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Git introduction to storing, and versioning your files on your local machine.</li>
		<li>Github: How to sync to the github.com remote server</li>
		<li>Github publishing: How to publish your html files using the ‚Äúgh-pages‚Äù branch</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>HTML</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>List of common HTML elements: html, head, body, p, ul, li, a, etc</li>
		<li>DOM: How Chrom creates a Document from your HTML source</li>
		<li>DOM Tree: how all elements are organized in a tree structure</li>
		<li>The root element. Every element has a parent, except the html element. Which is the root.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>JSON</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Your preferences for Sublime are one big JSON object.</li>
		<li>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.</li>
		<li>It's a way to package up data. A JSON package can then be sent/received by many different applications or API's. It's the most popular data exchange format on the internet today.</li>
		<li>JSON was popularized by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford">Douglas Crockford</a>. Before that, we were stuck with the more verbose XML for data exchange.</li>
		<li>
			JSON object starts and ends with a curly braces.<br>
			<code>{ }</code>
		</li>
		<li>It is a notation for desribing an object.</li>
		<li>What's an object? An object is a list of properties.<br>
<code>{
chips,
cookies,
popcorn
}</code>

		</li>
		<li>What's a property? A property has a name and a value</li>
		<li>A property's name/value is separated by a colon.<br>
		<code>{ chips: "tortilla" }</code></li>
		<li>Just like a list in a sentance, properties are separated by comma's.
<br>
<code>
{ chips: "tortilla", cookies: "chocolate chip", popcorn: "kettle corn" }
</code>

		<li>A property name must always be a string. The value could be any type of object: string, number, boolean, an array, or another object (<em>object inception anyone?</em>). We will talk more about this once we get into JavaScript.</li>
	</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>Saving a file. Three ways</li>
			<li>Opening your html file in Chrome. Three ways.</li>
			<li>Sublime: HTML tag auto-complete. Type ‚ÄúHtml‚Äù, press tab. Type ‚Äúp‚Äù, press tab.</li>
			<li>Sublime: Insert the closing tag for whatever tag is currently open. Press Cmd + Opt + . (the period, like ending a sentence).</li>
<li>Cmd + Right Arrow ‚Äî Move cursor to <strong>end of the line</strong></li>
<li>Cmd + Left Arrow ‚Äì Move cursor to <strong>beginning of the line</strong></li>
<li>Opt + Right Arrow ‚Äî Advance cursor to <strong>next word</strong></li>
<li>Opt + Left Arrow ‚Äî Move cursor back to <strong>previous word</strong></li>

		</ul>

		<h2>Pro Tips</h2>
		<p>1. Never have to remember to save an html file again! Setup Sublime with: <pre>save_on_focus_lost</pre></p>

<code>
{
	"save_on_focus_lost": true
}
</code>

		<p>2. Always open a project in Sublime in "folder mode". You do this by dragging the folder from the Finder onto the Sublime icon in the dock. This way you see all your source files/folders for that project in the left sidebar in Sublime.</p>
