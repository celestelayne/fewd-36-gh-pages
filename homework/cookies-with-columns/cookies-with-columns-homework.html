	<h1><a href="../../index.html">FEWD 36</a> - <a href="../../notes/week-3.html">Week 3</a> - Cookies with columns homework</h1>
</header>

<section>

<p>For your first CSS Layout homework, you'll be building upon the previous HTML that you created for the cookie recipe. The important lesson to learn here is to use the correct colors, spacing, and column layout to match the mockup. This is a very common task for a front end engineer.</p>

<p>"The Manual" for doing front end development is MDN. MDN is an abbreviation for the Mozilla Developer Network. You'll here me say MDN a lot. Bookmark it, love it, reference it often.</p>

<p>They have a page that lists out all the tags: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element</a>.

<p>Without further ado, here's the assigment:</p>

<h2>Due:</h2>
<p>Wednesday, 9/30 @ 6:30pm  (No class for Columbus Day)</p>

<h2>Given:</h2>

<ul>

	<li>Your final HTML from your first homework, the &quot;cookie recipe&quot;.</li>
	<li>Also given is a screenshot of what the final solution should look like. See below.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assignment:</h2>
<p>You task, is to add CSS as needed to make your cookie recipe match the design. Group together elements (in divs or sections) as needed to put them in columns or position them together.</h1>

<h2>Tips:</h2>
<p>Try to get it as pixel perfect as you can, but don't spend more than a few hours on it. The best approach is to go in broad strokes, guess the dimensions at first just to get "in the ball park", then go back later and take another pass and get things looking better, tighter, and more accurate.</p>
