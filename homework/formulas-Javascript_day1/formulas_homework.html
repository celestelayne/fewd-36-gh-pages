<h2>Main Topic: Functions!</h2>

	<p>Writing functions with parameters</p>
	<a target="_blank" href="formulas-Javascript_day1.zip">Download the ZIP</a> to get started. 

		<h2>Due:</h2>
			<p>Wednesday, 10/21/2015 @ 6:30pm</p>

		<h2>Given:</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>You'll see an index.html file. That's where your code will go. There's actually a place at the bottom that shows you exactly where to put your code. 
		</ol>

		<h2>Assignment:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>You have to use your developer tools to complete this assignment. 
				<li>The four functions you're writing can't just be called anything. They must be "called" certain things. *hint:  In which file are your FOUR new functions that you are creating being called from?</li> 
				<li>When declaring these functions, be sure to include the appropriate parameters. That's what you need to figure out.</li>
				<li>They also must each return a number. </li>
				<li>Once they return the right number, you'll see that number appear in the interface (we practiced seeing things in your console, but when done correctly, it will return it into your interface)</li>
				<li>As always, link the final results (all three files) to your own Github page.</li>
			</ol>
