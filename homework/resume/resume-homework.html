	<li>Your own awesome design skillz for picking colors, fonts, and spacing.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Assignment:</h2>
<p>Create your own resume site. It should have at least two pages, an ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù page and a ‚ÄúResume‚Äù page. These two pages should share the same external CSS file. Use the Wendy Bite example as a starting point, but if you‚Äôd like to get creative, feel free to change the fonts, colors, spacing, and borders to match your own style.</p>

<h2>Notes/Tips:</h2>
<p>Most of the homework assignments will be to build something specific. This is one of the few assignments that is a little more open-ended. You get to build your own resume with your own information and your own look &amp; feel. Use the Wendy Bite as a starting point, and then add your own content, colors, spacing, borders to fit your personality.</p>
